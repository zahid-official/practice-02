    <h1><u>Paragraph: My Favorite Subject</u></h1>
    <p>Since I entered my school I have a special attraction towards mathematics. I study mathematics with full interest and other subjects because I have to as they are a part of my curriculum. Mathematics is my favorite subject.Mathematics always gives me a level of satisfaction and extra energy while studying. I can solve problems related to mathematics for hours without getting bored. Whenever I face any difficulty in solving any problem I take my fatherâ€™s help to do so. My father is a Mechanical Engineer. He has a very good knowledge regarding the subject. He teaches me easy ways to learn the subject well. He has taught me a technique called visual representation which is very helpful. He takes efforts to search more easy ways online. He tries to collect and play intuitive videos on YouTube to make mathematics more fun. My aim in life is to become a mathematics professor or mathematician someday.</p>

    <p>The major reason why I like mathematics is that I do not have to memorize everything like a parrot like I have to do in other subjects. To acquire good marks in mathematics you just need to have sufficient mental logic for the subject. This subject is also demanding in various education fields. This is the only subject in which you can score full marks and raise your overall percentage.The most amazing part of this subject is that you just have to remember some formulas to solve the problems. It is needless to say that mathematics is a very logical subject and does not require any kind of boring memory work like other subjects especially Geography & History.</p>

    <p>For me remembering facts and dates is very difficult while mathematical reasoning is quiet easy. Some of my friends find this subject very difficult. I wonder why. In my spare time I help my friends to solve mathematical problems. As far as mathematics is concerned homework & tests are easy to achieve. I really get surprised to see my classmates getting punished for not completing the mathematics homework. However every individual on this earth has his/ her own kind of likes and dislikes.</p>
